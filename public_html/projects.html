                <p>As part of AFSHu's advocacy to support research and scholarship, we are also launching PROJECT BROWN BAG. A brown bag session typically gathers individuals to bring and eat their lunches together while listening to a speaker, who facilitates knowledge transfer and skill development. </p>
                <p>In AFSHu parlance, PROJECT BROWN BAG caters to any Filipino bachelors, masters, or doctoral students, who would like to present their research article - already published in a peer-reviewed academic journal - through a webinar format. </p>
                <p>From January to March, AFSHu already invited student speakers who will deliver informative and engaging lectures. If you are interested to be one of our speakers from April onwards, we invite you to fill up an application form. You may access the form through this link: <a href="https://bit.ly/afshu_bbapplicant">https://bit.ly/afshu_bbapplicant</a> </p>

                        <p>This year, AFSHu is launching a new project, which we call KUMUSTUHAN, that will hopefully benefit the entire Filipino student community in Hungary. AFSHu will visit various cities to meet with Filipino students. As an informal activity, AFSHu aims to commune with its members and gain insights on their varied experiences as international students. Through this, we hope to formulate better activities that target the needs of Filipino students. </p>
                        <p>Keep in touch with your Uni's Board of Director to get updates regarding the KUMUSTAHAN in your city.</p>

                        <p>On May 3, 2024, the University of Debrecen (UniDeb) conducted the annual International Food Day where at least 30 countries participated and shared their local culinary delights. For several years now, the Filipino student community in UniDeb actively participates in this endeavor as proceeds from the event will go to charity.</p>
                        <p>This year, the International Food Day became extra special as Ambassador Frank Cimafranca and Consul Ria Gorospe of the Embassy of the Philippines graced the event and mingled with the Filipino students.</p>
                        <p>As for the food, the Filipino student community prepared three dishes: chicken afritada, pancit, and bibingka. The International Food Day 2024 was also considered as the last leg of the Project Kumustahan of AFSHu. </p>
